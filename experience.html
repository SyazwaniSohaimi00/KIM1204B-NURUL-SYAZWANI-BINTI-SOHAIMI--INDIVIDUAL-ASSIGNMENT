<h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
<h2>Class Assistant</h2>
<p>When i in secondary school, i been class assistant for around one year.
It happen in my last year in Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Pekula Jaya (SMKPJ).
One of the student in my class gives my name to become Class Assistant when i do have around.
In my duty, i need to lead the salam when teacher enter class (happen when Class Leader do not have).
I also need to know the student attendant, whose come and whose not come.
Because this was my first time become Class Assistant, i having some trouble to handle it at first.
But finally, i become more comfortable to do my duty.</p>
<h2>Camp</h2>
<p>I have experience join camp under my curriculum club with my friend in my secondary school. 
This camp being held for giving promotion.
This mean this camp is for promotion to new or old members of school youth cadet (KRS).
This camp being held in forest and this the first time i experience sleep in tent.
I have been learn how to build tent in my school and need with help from other student from different school.
This because tent so big and difficult to handle with only two person.
I meet a lot new student from other school because this camp are for all school youth cadet in Kedah.
Meet new friend, know new name of school, and not only that in this camp we being train to become super dicipline.
Can not late, do not waste food, need to become brave, become more confident, and more.
In this camp i meet some people who crying because can not stand with ridicule, need to stand fine because wasting food, and many more.
The more you stand the more hard it become.
But only one thing i know, because i accept this challenge i need to ensure i try my best no matter what happen.
At last day, my name being called to receive promotion as coperal and it make me feel very happy for what i have face.</p>
<h2>Canteen Day</h2>
<p>This program usually being held by almost all school no matter primary or secondary.
At my secondary school, i join to help my school youth cadet (KRS) in their Canteen Day.
There was two times i join become volunteer. 
The first our club sold food and the second one sold water.
When first time join i nearly not leave my club sold food until i almost forgot to enjoy myself in Canteen Day.
In second time i become more enjoy become volunteer.
In both time because we sold main dishes, there was to many people come that make me become too tired.
Need to packing, need to sold, and need to smile. 
This three combo make me very tired until i become not energized to enjoy my Canteen Day that time.
This happen when my first try to become volunteer.
But in my second try, when we sold water, it still a lot of customer but i still can enjoy my Canteen Day.
For me become volunteer can sometime gives experience and also can help spent my time.</p>
<h2>Instructor</h2>
<p>This happen in my secondary school.
I decided to help my teacher handle new student.
As i remembered, i need to wait all new student come and called their name to divide them into class.
I also help to sent them to their class and monitor them until school time end.
This task actually quite hard because student nowadays actually quite stubborn.
I almost become angry to them because not hear their name being called.
Not only that, they was talk at the same time we call their name.
If like this how can them hear their name, right.
This problem not end like that mostly when arrived their class they make noise without.
Although they have been told to quiet they still not hear.
But this task end smoothly at the end.</p>
<h2>Running Bisafa</h2>
<p>This program was being held when i am in semester 2 at UiTM Kedah. 
This program is quite similar to Running Man program.
I join this program with one of my friend.
We decided to join this program because this program have unique name that attract our interest.
We combined with some of student from Office Management course.
In this game, i gain some experience like what i have seen in television.
I experience someone chase me so faster, experience to take care my name tag carefully, 
experience the feeling when someone chase me, and many more.
I totally not like someone chase me.
The feeling when someone chase you totally make me very afraid.
At that time because very afraid, i ran and separated with other members.
I also ran across hill and hide in toilet.
I almost feel do not want to went out anymore.
But because remember this was competition, i tried my best.
Finally our team become number two.
It make me feel relieved because our hard we win.
It feel good not give up.</p>
